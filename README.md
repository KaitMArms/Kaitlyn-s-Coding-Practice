<p align="center> # Kaitlyn's Coding Practice </p>

## Highlights of the QnA Below
- I am practicing six languages: Python, TypeScript, C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript.  
- My focus is on improving my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving gained from working in Data Structures I & II and OOP.  
- For each problem, I solve it in a less familiar language first and then translate it to other languages to reinforce my understanding.  
- I maintain a consistent style and method structure across all files to make reviewing my code easier.  
  
### What is this project?
This collection of coding files shows my progress practicing a variety of languages. My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving; as well as refamiliarize myself with languages I learned years ago like Python, and teach myself languages like TypeScript, C++, and C#.

### What is my process?
To find problems, I usually ask an AI platform (typically GPT) to generate questions in areas I want to practice. I ask clarifying questions as I work through them. My approach is to solve each problem in a language I’m less familiar with first, then translate it to languages I know better. I look up libraries and methods if I’m unfamiliar with them, and I reference past work to keep consistency across files. I also try to keep my style and methods consistent since it makes looking back at my code much easier.

### Are there downsides to this process?
100%. One major downside I’ve noticed while working in six languages at once is that features blur together. For example, when finding the length of an array, I’ll sometimes accidentally use `.length` instead of `.size` or vice versa. Small errors like that can make the process slightly inefficient, but overall the pros outweigh the cons and this method works well for me.

### Do I have any plans to expand the languages I’m currently covering?
Yes and no. I’ve looked into languages like Rust and Go, which have peaked my interest, and I might add them in the future. However, for now, actively working in six languages is enough for me. I currently want to prioritize the languages in this portfolio due to their prevalance in many intership and job listings I have seen in my areas of interest, so other languages got cut for the sake of fast paced practice and development. In the future, Rust and Go would be my first choices to add onto what I have already accomplished, but for now remain on the back-burner.

## Are there any languages that will likely never appear in this practice?
Yes. I dislike plain C. Manual memory allocation and debugging segmentation faults is one of the least enjoyable parts of coding for me. Combined with the fact that it’s not commonly used in the sectors I’m interested in, it’s not something I plan to prioritize in my practice. I joke that Seg faults are my mortal enemy, so why would I invite them to the coding party that is this practice compilation lol
